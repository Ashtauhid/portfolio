          <p style="text-align: justify">
            My name's Ashraful Tauhid, born in 22nd September of 1995. With the
            advancement from a giant cellular phone to smartphones, I grew up.
            But one thing remained the same all along and that is the
            fascination towards technology. From the day I played my first ever
            video game (DX-Ball) I was determined to pursue my study in
            technology. Just like that I followed through my dream untill now.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            I completed my Secondary School Certificate (SSC) from Cantonment

            in 2014. I graduated in December of 2018 from Bangladesh University
            of Professionals (BUP) in Information and Communication Engineering
            (ICE) with a CGPA of
            <b><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">3.71/4.0</span></b

            at BUP for excellence in semester results based on GPA.

            Currently, I'm preparing myself for my masters hopefully in
            information security or closely entitled field of studies.
            Information security and Human-Computer Interactions are the two of
            my most fascinated subjects to study in because of their salient
            impacts on people's life.

            projects for android. One of my team's app idea also got listed in
            the top 500 apps in a contest name EATL app content. Some of the
            projects were chat-bot, pedometer and calorie counter, controlling

            I'm more or less of a try-hard player on fortnite. Check me out, IGN: Ashraful Tauhid.<br>
            I love all genres of music except hard-core metals cause I don't really understand the lyrics behind the musics. But alternative rock is the most preferable.<br>
            I've traveled every eminent tourist destinations in Bangladesh except Sundarbans. I always dream of traveling all-around the world to understand the saying "The world is a global village".
